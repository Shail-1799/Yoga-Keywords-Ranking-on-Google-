# Yoga-Keywords-Ranking-on-Google-


Ever since the lockdown was called, 'Yoga' remains one of the most searched and practiced activities all around the globe. 



So, I decided to see how these things take place and how these searches can be optimized. Also, to see if there's any relation between any specific search terms and keywords?



Here are the details of my complete Data Science Project that I've been working on from few days. Kindly have a look at it:)



Title : Yoga Keywords Ranking on Google 



Problem Statement: 



Suppose your marketing team is working with a client - who are trying to rank their website in Yoga segment. They are looking for some insights on rankings for the most popular keywords - and hand over a dump of keywords.



Problems Solved


1. Which domain/website ranks prominently in the search results. 

2. Text Analysis - absolute and weighted frequency (From Title, Meta Description).

3. Is there any co-relation between rankings and emojis? What are the most frequently used emojis? Is there a special pattern?

4. Is there any co-relation of numbers or dates to the ranking?
